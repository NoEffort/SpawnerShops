A small plugin for Minecraft that I would like to expand on and enhance the code.

The Main.java class is the only class file in this program, and it is very long and repetetive.
What is the best way to shorten the code? Any suggestion is valid.

** HELP: Error in code pointed out @ line(s) 133 - 143, post your potential suggestions!
